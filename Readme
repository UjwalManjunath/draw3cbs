The program interface has a drawing canvas to draw three basic colored shapes: lines, circles and rectangles.
To draw a shape the user clicks twice at two different points  p1 and p2.
Let d be  the distance between p1 and p2 and X is some integer value, e.g. 100.·       
If d <= X draw a line between p1 and p2.  
  Mark the two ends of the line with two small solid circles.·        
If  d > X and d <= 2X draw a circle centered between p1 and p2 with diameter d. 
  Mark the center and the two points with small solid circle.·       
If d > 2X draw a rectangle with two of its vertices at p1 and p2. 
  Mark the four vertices with small solid circles. 

In addition the program has three control areas:·        
  Color Control:  To select a color from five colors: Red, Green, Blue, Brown and Orange:                    
  Program Control: Contains two buttons*:
        Quit: Exit the program with a chance to confirm or cancel.
        Clear:  Clears the drawing area with a chance to confirm or cancel.   

*The interaction with these control buttons follows a "modal" interface –one that prevents the user from 
interacting with the application until completing the current activity.
