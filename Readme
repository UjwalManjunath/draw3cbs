The program interface has a drawing canvas to draw three basic colored shapes: lines, circles and squares.
To draw a line the distance between two points should be less than 100
To draw a circle the distance between the two points must be greater than 100 and less than 200
if distance between two points is greater than 200 , a rectangle is drawn.

Five colors that i have chosen are Red, Green, Blue, Brown and Orange.
